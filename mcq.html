        <p>Sedimentary rocks are formed by the process of sedimentation. Layer after layer of minerals
             is deposited over a great span of time, resulting in the formation of a sedimentary rock.
              As a result, each layer is different if the conditions under which its deposits were different. 
              Thus we can say that a sedimentary rock is a sort of museum, holding the records of all the time
               over which it was for which by all means can be as long as a billion years.</p>
               <br><br>

                  <p>The constitution of India is very well written. It not only defines the need for fundamental human rights but 
                    also ensures that we do not abuse these laws. The access to justice is one such law but in the present
                     political scenario, this right like other such rights has been hidden from the marginalized section 
                     of the society.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>4.The above paragraph says what about the Indian constitution?</p>
                     <br>
                     <input type="radio" value="">It is very well written</input><br>
                     <input type="radio" value="">It ensures everyone has basic rights.</input><br>
                     <input type="radio" value="">The marginalized sections of the society donâ€™t enjoy the rights guaranteed by 
                     the constitution.</input><br>

                     <p>Space exploration is a very exciting field of research. It is the frontier of Physics and no doubt will change the
                         understanding of science. However, it does come at a cost. A normal space shuttle costs about 1.5 billion dollars to make. 
                         The annual budget of NASA, which is a premier space exploring organization is about $17 billion.
                        So the question that some people ask is that whether it is worth it?</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>5.What is the main idea in the paragraph?</p>
                        <br>
                        <input type="radio" value="">NASA has a budget of $17 billion.</input><br>
                        <input type="radio" value="">The money spent on NASA can be used otherwise.</input><br>
                        <input type="radio" value="">Space exploration is costly and some people are worried.
                     </input><br>
